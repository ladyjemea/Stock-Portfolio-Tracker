Project: Stock Portfolio Tracker

Frontend: Python (Flask or Django)

For the frontend, you can use Python along with web frameworks like Flask or Django to create the user interface for the stock portfolio tracker. Here's how it could work:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization using Flask-Django User Authentication modules.
Dashboard: Create a dashboard where users can add, view, and manage their stock portfolios. This dashboard will display various metrics such as total portfolio value, individual stock holdings, and performance over time.
Stock Search: Implement a search functionality where users can search for stocks by symbol or company name using AJAX requests to the backend.
Portfolio Visualization: Use libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib to visualize the portfolio's performance through interactive charts and graphs.
User Settings: Allow users to customize their settings, such as preferred currency, timezone, or display preferences.
Backend: Golang (Go)

For the backend, you'll use Golang to handle the business logic, interact with external APIs for fetching real-time stock data, and manage the database. Here's an outline of the backend components:

API Integration: Use Golang's HTTP client to interact with financial APIs like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance to fetch real-time stock prices, historical data, and company information.
Data Processing: Process the data received from the API responses, such as parsing JSON data and extracting relevant information like stock prices, company names, and symbols.
Database Management: Use a relational database like PostgreSQL or SQLite to store user portfolios, stock holdings, transactions, and user settings. You'll define database schemas and interact with the database using Golang's database/sql package or an ORM like GORM.
Authentication and Authorization: Implement authentication and authorization middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints and data.
RESTful API: Design and implement a RESTful API using Golang's standard library or a lightweight framework like Gin or Echo. This API will expose endpoints for user registration, authentication, portfolio management, stock search, and data visualization.
Features:

Portfolio Management: Users can create, edit, and delete multiple portfolios, each containing a list of stocks they own.
Real-Time Stock Data: The application fetches real-time stock prices, allowing users to see their portfolio's current value and performance.
Transaction Tracking: Users can add buy/sell transactions for each stock in their portfolio, and the application will update the portfolio's holdings and performance accordingly.
Performance Metrics: Display various performance metrics for each portfolio, such as total return, percentage gain/loss, and annualized return.
Notifications: Implement price alerts and notifications for users when a stock in their portfolio reaches a certain price threshold.
Export/Import: Allow users to export their portfolio data to CSV or PDF formats and import portfolios from external sources.
